# Introduction to machine learning: half day course
This course provides a short introduction to machine learning. It covers:

- What is machine learning?
- An introduction to unsupervised learning: dimensionality reduction via PCA; and clustering using k-means
- An introduction to supervised learning: linear regression and logistic regression

The course consists of a lecture and a number of problem sets. You are free to take whichever of the below seems most appealing to you:

- unsupervised learning:
  - [*Clustering via k-means*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_clustering_problems.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own clustering algorithm using the k-means method. The answers (written in R) to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_clustering_problems_answers.nb.html).
- supervised learning:
  - [*Linear regression*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_linear_regression_problems.nb.html). Here, participants train their own linear regression model and investigate how the hyperparameters of gradient descent affect training efficiency. The answers to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_linear_regression_problems_answers.nb.html).
  - [*K-nearest-neighbour regression*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_knn_problems.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own KNN regression model. The answers to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_knn_problems_answers.nb.html).
