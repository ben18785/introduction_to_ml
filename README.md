# Introduction to machine learning: half day course
This course provides a short introduction to machine learning. It covers:

- What is machine learning?
- An introduction to unsupervised learning: dimensionality reduction via PCA; and clustering using k-means
- An introduction to supervised learning: linear regression and logistic regression

The course consists of a [lecture](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/main/presentations/intro_to_ml.html) and a number of problem sets.

There is an introductory problem set which is recommended for all newbies to machine learning:
- [using linear regression to predict house prices](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_applied_regression.nb.html). Here participants apply linear regression modelling and investigate how the model complexity affects its performance on training, validation and testing sets. The answers to this exercise are written in R [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_applied_regression.nb.html).

- unsupervised learning:
  - [*Clustering via k-means*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_clustering_problems.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own clustering algorithm using the k-means method, which they then apply to the famous [_Iris_](./problem_sets/data/iris.csv) dataset (see the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) for a good description of it). The answers (written in R) to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_clustering_problems_answers.nb.html).
- supervised learning:
  - [*Linear regression*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_linear_regression_problems.nb.html). Here, participants train their own linear regression model and investigate how the hyperparameters of gradient descent affect training efficiency. The answers to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_linear_regression_problems_answers.nb.html).
  - [*K-nearest-neighbour regression*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_knn_problems.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own KNN regression model. The answers to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_knn_problems_answers.nb.html).
