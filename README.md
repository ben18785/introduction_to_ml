# Introduction to machine learning: half day course
This course provides a short introduction to machine learning. It covers:

- What is machine learning?
- An introduction to unsupervised learning: dimensionality reduction via PCA; and clustering using k-means
- An introduction to supervised learning: linear regression and logistic regression

The course consists of a lecture and a number of problem sets. You are free to take whichever of the below seems most appealing to you:

- unsupervised learning:
  - [*Clustering via k-means*](./problem_sheets/s_clustering_problems.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own clustering algorithm using the k-means method.
- supervised learning:
  - *K-nearest-neighbour regression*. Here, participants code up their own KNN regression model
  - *Linear regression*. Here, participants train their own linear regression model
